鱷龜是一個巨大的半水生爬行動物，在世界各地的沼澤中發現。
不像其中立的海龜表親，鱷龜像是一個脾氣暴躁的野獸，攻擊任何靠近的東西
用其尖銳的鳥喙。 對一個海龜來說，能夠咬速和移動令人驚訝的快
 遇到這些生物時，不要理會它們。 Alligator Snapping Turtles rarely move, and it is common for
 moss growth to build up on their shells over several days underwater.

If mossy, they can be sheared for a chance to drop a Spiked Scute. These can be used to upgrade the Sea Turtle shell helmet.
The Spiked Turtle Shell helmet has built in knockback resistance and allows players to breathe underwater for 15 extra seconds. It also
can knock back melee attacks occasionally. Alligator Snapping Turtles can be bred with raw cod.
