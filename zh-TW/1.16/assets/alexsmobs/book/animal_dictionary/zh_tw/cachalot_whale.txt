抹香鯨是一種大型的中立哺乳動物，存在於溫熱、寒冷和深的海洋中，在那裡可以看到牠最喜歡的獵物 - 魷魚。
他們通過回音定位鎖定它們的獵物，聲音撞擊到烏賊的時候會反彈，以便鯨魚確認它的位置。
然後，鯨魚開始加速並張開嘴巴露出銳利的牙齒，以衝入獵物。 Occasionally, the whale may drop one of these long teeth in the process.
These whales are capable of breaking ice when they move, but if charging they can break boats and other kinds of wood. Rarely, all-white whales can be found, which are much stronger than other whales.

The Cachalot Whale may seem like a giant, but it still is threatened by a few forces of nature. Orca whales love to eat young Cachalots, and their mothers will try to fiercely defend them from harm.
During powerful thunderstorms, Cachalot Whales may spawn washed up on beaches. They are helpless in this form, and if pushed back into the water without being hurt, may decide to reward their saviors.
The reward for this task is in the form of Ambergris, a valuable byproduct of the whale's stomach that is coughed up. Ambergris can be traded to fishermen villagers for a great deal of emeralds, or can be used to craft an Echolocator.
It can also be used as a powerful fuel that can smelt 64 items.

The Echolocator can be used to reveal nearby caves. Once a cave has been found it will release a sound wave in the direction of the cave. One should be conservative with this tool, since it has limited number of uses.
If crafted with 4 ender pearls, one can make a Endolocator, which can reveal the location of the End Portal when near a stronghold.
