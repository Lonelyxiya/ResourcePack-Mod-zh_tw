Squeezer
Pressing matters
The Squeezer is a multiblock structure that presses juice or oil out of organic materials by use of a big piston. The structure is built as shown above and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the central wooden barrel, from the side that has the Engineering Blocks.
Items can be input into the Squeezer via the two hatches at the back that are marked with blue dots. 帶有橙色圓點的艙口作為物品輸出，它下面的方塊輸出流體。
在前面的控制面板上通入紅石信號將停止機器的進程，可以用工程師錘來逆轉。
