採礦鑽機
我的鑽頭可是突破基岩的鑽頭啊！
<&drill_base_recipes>手持式柴油動力鑽機是採礦業的一大進步。 可以透過更換鑽頭或升級，其性能幾乎完全可以修改。 將鑽頭放入<link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start>進行自定義。 將鑽頭放入<link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start>進行自定義。 The drill runs off of <link;refinery;Biodiesel;start> and can be filled directly in the refinery.<np> 將鑽頭放入<link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start>進行自定義。 The drill runs off of <link;refinery;Biodiesel;start> and can be filled directly in the refinery.<np> 將鑽頭放入<link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start>進行自定義。 The drill runs off of <link;refinery;Biodiesel;start> and can be filled directly in the refinery.<np>
<&drill_head_recipes>The §2Drill Head§r determines the base §2mining level§r, §2speed§r, and §2size§r, as well as the §2attack damage§r. 挖掘方塊時，鑽頭會受損，可在鐵砧進行修復。<np>
<&drill_waterproof_recipe>As the drill is powered by a combustion engine, it will not run underwater unless you equip it with the §2Pressurized Air Tank§r Upgrade. However, with this upgrade equipped, it will not only run while submerged, but also ignore the slowdown usually experienced when digging in water.<np>
<&drill_lube_recipe>The §2Advanced Lubrication System§r applied additional lubricant to the drill at a regular basis, decreasing the durability loss of the drill head.<np>
<&drill_damage_recipe>By adding §2Additional Augers§r to the drill, its destructive potential is increased, increasing its damage against living creatures and allowing it to run and dig faster. The upgrade stacks up to three times.<np>
<&drill_capacity_recipe>The §2Large Fuel Tank§r allows the drill to store more fuel internally, extending the time you can use it before refilling.
