左輪彈藥

左輪手槍彈藥需要工程師裝配台以及特定的<link;blueprints;Engineer's Blueprints>才能製作。 你自己就可以繪製一般軍火的製造藍圖，但一些高級軍火的藍圖需要你從他人手中購買才能得到。<np>
<&empty>§lEmpty §lCasings§r and §lShells§r 是所有子彈的基礎。 空彈殼也可以使用<link;metal_press;Metal Press>,使用合適的模具，大大降低成本。<np>
<&casull>§lCasull §lCartridges§r是用“普通子彈”藍圖創建的。 它們是一種簡單的鉛彈，造成中等傷害。<np>
<&ap>§lArmor-Piercing §lCartridges§r 使用相同的藍圖創建。 它們造成相同數量的傷害，但通過純粹的動能穿透裝甲。<np>
<&buckshot>§lBuckshot §lCartridges§r, created with the aformentioned blueprint, are filled with multiple small projectiles that are fired out in a cone shape. This cartridge is highly effective at short range.<np>
<&he>§lHigh-Explosive §lCartridges§r are created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint. They fire a projectile that explodes on impact, causing damage to living creatures and terrain.<np>
<&silver>§lSilver §lCartridges§r, also created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint, consist of a lead core wrapped in silver, making them highly effective against undead.<np>
<&dragon>§lDragon's §lBreath Cartridges§r are created with a "Specialized Projectiles" blueprint. Similarly to Buckshot, they are effective at short range, but instead of small metal shots, they are filled with a flammable metal dust, creating a blast of flame.<np>
<&potion>§lPhial §lCartridges§r are also created with a "Specialized" blueprint. They can be filled with any potion by crafting them together in a crafting grid and this potion will then be applied on impact. Normal potions require a direct hit, splash potions have an area of effect and Lingering Potions will create a temporary, lingering potion cloud.<np>
<&flare>§lFlare §lCartridges§r are created with a "Specialized" blueprint. When fired, the flare explodes after a certain distance and then slowly sinks to the ground. You can combine the cartridge with dyes in a crafting table to change its colour.<np>
<&homing>§lHoming §lCartridges§r are created with a "Specialized Projectiles" blueprint. Using the intriguing properties of an Eye of Ender, these projectiles gain the ability to seek out and chase the closest target.
<&wolfpack>§lWolfpack §lCartridges§r are created with the same blueprint and consist of a collection of multiple homing shots in a single shell. The initial projectile is unguided, but on impact, it splits into six target seeking shots that shred surrounding enemies.
