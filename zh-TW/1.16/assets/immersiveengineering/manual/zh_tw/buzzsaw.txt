電鋸
我們不去拉文霍姆
<&recipes>這款大型便攜式圓鋸設計用於快速加工樹木和其他可能阻礙原始工廠建築的樹葉。
使用 <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start> 將鋸片放入其中，並裝載<link;refinery;Biodiesel;start> 或其他燃料後，它可以用來雕刻從小樺木到大樺木的任何東西甚至叢林樹木。

像其他一些工具一樣，可以在<link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench> These upgrades affect the size of the internal tank and the durability of its sawblade.
<np>
<&rockcutter_recipe>By replacing the normal saw- blade with a §2Rockcutter Blade§r, the buzzsaw can be used to cleanly cut cubes of stone from the ground, much like the §2Silktouch§r enchantment. However, the diamond tipped blade is no longer useful in carving through wood or felling trees.<np>
<&tank_recipe>The §2Large Tank§r increases the fluid capacity of the buzzsaw by 2000 mb.<np>
<&lube_recipe>The §2Advanced Lubrication System§r applies additional lubricant to the sawblade, reducing the speed at which it loses durability.<np>
<&quiver_recipe>By attaching the §2Blade Quiver§r to the side of the buzzsaw, you can carry two additional sawblades along. You can cycle between the stored blades by <config;b;tools.chemthrower.scroll;sneaking and using the scrollwheel, or through use of;using> the keybind §l<keybind;key.immersiveengineering.chemthrowerSwitch>§r if it has been set in the options.
