避雷針
轟天雷！
Lightning is a phenomenon of nature. It contains a huge amount of raw power, and this lightning rod is able to harness that power.
在此多方塊結構放置一堆鋼柵欄提高雷雨中被閃電擊中的機會。
When the steel pole is struck, the huge amounts of energy created are stored in the base of the lightning rod and then slowly distributed to the energy connections at the sides.

You can improve the chances of the Lightning Rod getting struck by creating a "net" of steel fences connected to the topmost fence.
