Refinery
Fluid mixing!
<&multiblock>The Refinery is a complex multiblock that can refine one or two fluids into another. The most common application of this is the refinement of <link;squeezer;Plant Oil;start> and <link;fermenter;Ethanol;start> into Biodiesel.
To form the structure, rightclick the Heavy Engineering Block on the middle layer.
Fluids are input through the two ports on either side of the block and output through the orange marked port at the front.
