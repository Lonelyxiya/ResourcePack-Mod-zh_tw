<&copper>§lCopper Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.copper.min_y> and <config;i;ores.copper.max_y>, and requires a Stone Pickaxe to harvest.
The ore will smelt into copper ingots, which are used in crafting basic copper wires, coils, and other integral parts of the IE architecture.
<&alu>§lBauxite Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.bauxite.min_y> and <config;i;ores.bauxite.max_y>, and requires a Stone Pickaxe to harvest.
The ore will smelt into aluminium ingots, which, together with steel, are used to create high-voltage wires.
<&lead>§lLead Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.lead.min_y> and <config;i;ores.lead.max_y>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
礦石會熔煉成鉛錠，可用來製作電容。
<&silver>§lSilver Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.silver.min_y> and <config;i;ores.silver.max_y>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
The ore will smelt into silver ingots, which alloy with gold to create electrum, a far more effective conductor.
<&nickel>§l鎳礦§r能在主世界<config;i;ores.nickel.min_y>到 <config;i;ores.nickel.max_y>層找到，需要鐵鎬或更高等級的鎬來開採。
此礦石可熔煉成鎳錠，鎳與銅合金製成康銅，康銅是一種用於製造<link;thermoelectric;Thermoelectric Generators;start>的耐熱導體。
<&uranium>§lUranium Ore§r is found in the world between layers <config;i;ores.uranium.min_y> and <config;i;ores.uranium.max_y>, and requires an Iron Pickaxe to harvest.
The ore will smelt into uranium ingots, but there are currently not many uses for the metal. A uranium block can serve as a heatsource for the <link;thermoelectric;Thermoelectric Generator;start> and the metal will be used in future endeavours.
