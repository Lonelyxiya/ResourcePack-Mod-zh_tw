After receiving energy, it will drop down a pipe looking for fluids to pump.$(br2)There is no hard limit, except for the fluid's physics. As long as there is fluid touching the pump's pipe, source or not, it will look for a source block to pump. This means it can be used to drain lava lakes from the Nether."
