      "text": "The Regulator Tube Module is an $(l:tubes/tube_modules#inline)inline/$ module used to limit the $(l:base_concepts/pressure)pressure/$ allowed through the tube. By default, the module will regulate the pressure to 4.9 bar (for both basic and advanced tubes) with no redstone signal, reducing toward 0 as the signal rises toward 15. This means a lever right beside a regulator closes it, preventing any air flow through it."

You can set a precise threshold in the GUI, or with the $(bold)Advanced Config/$ checkbox, configure interpolated threshold levels based on the redstone signal. This functions exactly like the $(l:tubes/safety_module)Safety Module/$."
