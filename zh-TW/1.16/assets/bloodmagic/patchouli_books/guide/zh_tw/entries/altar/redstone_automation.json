If you want to speed it up, you'd best look into $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_rune/acceleration_rune)Acceleration Runes$() and $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_rune/dislocation_rune)Displacement Runes$()."

This tank can hold up to 10% of the blood that the altar itself can, so if the numbers don't appear to be adding up exactly right, or if blood appears to be vanishing from your altar, this is probably where it's going. The same limitations apply to blood being piped in."

This can be used to, for example, deactivate certain rituals when you are running low on LP, to ensure you don't run out. $(br2)Lastly, placing a $(item)Redstone Lamp$()$(strike) underneath the altar will make it output a redstone signal upon finishing a crafting operation. With a bit of cunning, this should allow you to fully automate the production of slates."
