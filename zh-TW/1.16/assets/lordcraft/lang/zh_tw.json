The Order has long since declined but their legacy lives on in the people of the continent and their great city of Idras who's walls still keep safe many from the threats leftover from the conflict. The remnants of the Order now stand guard at the Gates of Dara, the only valley connecting the Outlands to the world beyond.",

The union was disbanded at the Peace of Idras by the Thelos Zaloweist but there are still many Lords who follow it's tenets particularly those who seek to empower their magic.",

Their goal was to at any cost restore him to this position despite his apparent apathy to the situation. As such they opposed the Union of Ava in the War of the Elements and thus their actions brought upon the realms nearly a thousand years of chaos. Their ranks comprised of the Celestial Nations of Light and Darkness, but in the Peace of Idras they were disbanded by the Thelos Zaloweist. Despite the peace many of them consider the war unfinished, as such for many years the Thelos spent time routing out those who still followed these ideals.",

A group of lords experimented into the flow of mana in life, seeking a way to attain the ability of eternal youth that the Overlords kept secret. Their studies revealed that blood assists in carrying it through the body, as such they began using their magic to drain mana from the blood of those around them. Over time the efficiency of this process was called into question and a solution had to be sought. The group cursed themselves such that they need not use magic to actively extract the mana, however this curse carried in their own blood proved to be hereditary thus Vampirism was born. This affliction is held only by a few lords these days, but the very idea that one may walk among us fills most with fear.",

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.15": "Now I have an understanding of how I can store my own energy within Void Crystals I have begun looking into ways to obtain more energy. In doing so i've realised that within the Void there is some form of store for each and every individual blessed with an understanding of magic. I have thus conceived of a device capable of interfacing with my such a store. Alongside this I have also though of a siphon like device that can be placed within the store to increase it's potential size. Now I have only to figure out how to provide it with energy, Void Pips seem incompatible, perhaps the elemental crystals?",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.16": "It has become apparent that it is tricky at times to determine the exact amount of mana I have accumulated. I had a vision of a strange eye, it was closed and yet I felt as if it was watching me. A voice called out from the murky darkness that surrounded me, it was compelling me to open the eye. As I awoke from my stupor I realised that I might be able to summon such an eye into this world using a ritual.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.17": "Finally I have found a real use for my powers, combined with my intellect I can construct a §nSpell Workbench§r in which I can manipulate a §nSpell Focus§r crystal to hold a spell of my own design. On top of this I have also developed a casting tool to hold it, a staff.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.objective.17": "I must be able to source mana from something, perhaps I should try the elemental crystals on my Void Interface. Once I have some, it should be easy to find a use for it.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.18": "It can be difficult at times to manage a staff with it's unwieldy need for two hands, as such I have designed a smaller variant that can be used in just one hand. These wands are a little weaker than staves but are still adequate for most purposes.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.19": "Staves have proven to be reasonably effective weapons despite their weight. I believe that if I were to use gold instead of iron in crafting my staves I can produce one with an increased damage output.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.objective.19": "Staves are capable weapons, if I make use of them in this way I may learn of ways to improve their combat effectiveness.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.20": "With my recent discovery of the material known as Magmite and my ability to fabricate it using rituals, I have designed a new staff that utilises the material to further increase it's damage capability.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.objective.20": "Much as with upgrading to gold I wish to upgrade the staff to use Magmite in future, the only issue is that it is not as simple as it would first appear, perhaps with more testing of the golden staves I will figure out a way to properly affix Magmite to staves.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.21": "As my mana pool grows I wish to test out more powerful spells, my staves however were not capable of this until now. I believe that if I were to infuse the wood of my amplification rods with gold they should be capable of channeling more powerful spells.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.objective.21": "I am finding myself limited by how powerful my staves are, perhaps by using them to cast spells I can conceive of a way to improve their ability to channel magic.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.22": "Again I find myself limited, even by my improved design, this time however I have a more long term solution, by processing the wood fusing it with magmite, I will be capable of channeling spells of any complexity when used to make a staff.",

The knowledge they have imparted on me has lead to this latest idea, an alternative to staves with the ability to store multiple spell foci at once. I must set to work on making one at once.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.24": "Another thought came to me by that voice, an idea to craft a more powerful stone by utilizing the strange stone my transmutation runes create. I speculate that this version will be able to hold even more spells at once. I wish I knew if the figure could hear me, then I could properly thank him for his guidance.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.25": "Reading these old scraps has revealed more about the Legacies which I most closely feel for.

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.26": "I was correct and was able to find additional scraps containing more information, I still believe there to be more but I have enough that I could piece together what I need. My abilities should improve from this, and now any further scraps I read will only provide an increase of my general knowledge.",

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.53": "With my discovery of infusion rituals complete, I have been looking for ways to make use of this new process. Testing with various natural materials I have discovered that it is possible to use infusion to cause them to hold magical properties, I deem that it may be possible to make robes from fabric made in such a way. It may require me to improve my workbench in some way to do this however.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.54": "I've heard much about the properties of Magmite but I thought that it was a natural material found in the earth. It turns out however it is created through magic, what questions that poses for the origin of the world are rather confusing but nevertheless I shall look into further uses for this material, for now however it would make for some good tools.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.55": "Now that I am able to seed crystals form the magical dust I have been collecting it has given me the idea to attempt to craft tools out of them, I believe they should be fairly capable, and if I were to infuse my workbench with an element I may even be able to craft tools out of the elemental crystals too, by my reckoning they should be even more powerful and perhaps even be able to channel energy through them in some way.",

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.77": "The Arcane Furnace is a powerful contraption and the first of many uses I expect for these new Void Crystals. It would seem that it is capable not only of smelting faster than a regular furnace but that the more energy that I give the crystal the faster it goes.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.78": "It has come to my attention that it is in fact possible given this improved furnace to process ores much more efficiently than I previously imagined. Now when smelting ores within the Arcane Furnace I should receive an additional ingot!",

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.87": "The voice in my head has spoken once again, a word drifting from so very far away passes from it's lips. This word I have been told holds within it the power to dismantle the very fabric of reality itself. I know not it's meaning or what it could possibly describe but somehow I know it is connected to myself. The word sounds almost as a name but I know not any by it. Monutan, I shall discover your meaning and this wandering spirit inside my mind shall help me.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.88": "Having realised my true potential I have begun to experiment how this can benefit some of my other works.

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.91": "The materials of this world have shown themselves able to be infused with magic to enhance their properties, some however are a little more resilient to change than others. I've seen a vision of a land far away from here, islands floating throughout the sky made of a strange stone with a blue hue, the voice tells me that is home but I do not know how to get there. Perhaps I can shift the stone of this world to be like that found in that skyland.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.92": "我已經研究過太多將自己傳送於各種地方的方法，可是我都還未能找到現世適用的方法，直到現在。我終於設計了一台名為 位移矩陣 的裝置，當它和標記一起使用時，我便應該能夠輕鬆地環遊世界各地。",

    "lordcraft.book_text.research.102": "I am finding that my increased potential is coming at a cost. As I continue to learn new spells I find myself increasingly unable to provide the mana required to cast them. I believe however that I may be able to resolve this somewhat, by modifying my void interface I can make it able to absorb items dropped near it instead of me placing them into it. This means I can automate the generation of mana to some degree. I also believe that these modifications make the new interface bind itself to my mana pool when placed.",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.103": "Forging magmite has given me an idea, with how easily I can manipulate it's shape might it not be possible to design a tool capable of being effective on any block? With this thought I set to work and now I have it! I have designed a multitool!",
    "lordcraft.book_text.research.104": "These robes are very good but so far their effectiveness is exclusive to spellcasting. I believe however that my connection to the void may indeed be stronger while wearing them, it's only a matter of feeling it for it to be so."
