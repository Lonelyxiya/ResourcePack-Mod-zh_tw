The Chemical Combiner allows you to combine elements, compounds, and occasionally other items to form new items. It contains 9 slots like a standard crafting grid, but unlike a crafting grid it allows each input slot to contain more than one item per craft."

Doing this will lock the machine slots, not allowing items into empty slots and only allowing the correct items into the correct slots for that recipe. Using this functionality is not absolutely required, as placing items with no recipe target will still work"

Second is the 'Pause' button which allows you to pause machine processing, however the machine will still accept energy and items"
