You can monitor items, energy, fluids, entities, machines, tanks, light, weather, direction, movement and much more.- -You can create Item, Fluid and Energy networks and transfer them anywhere in the world instantly; you can even transfer across dimensions. This mod also gives you more interactive control, via the use of Large Display Screens.- -This gives you infinite control and management of your base. You can also monitor and control blocks wirelessly.- -This mod is a continuation of the mod Practical Logistics 1.7.10.-This mod was created by Ollie Lansdell.",
