			"text": "One such theory, widely accepted by the wizardfolk, describes a cataclysmic event occurring thousands of years ago, commonly referred to as $(o)The Rift$(). $(br) Details are unclear, but based on the scraps of evidence discovered by wizard scholars over many millennia, it is concluded that $(o)The Rift$() caused all powerful forms of magic to be wiped out of the Overworld. Some scholars believe it was an accident, such as a powerful ritual gone awry; perhaps a wizard's foolish attempts to summon a primordial deity to gain even more powerful knowledge? Others say that it was intentional- that the ancient wizards hid their knowledge away due to the appearance of a terrifying new threat. Perhaps we will never find out the entire truth."
