  "name": "Cauldron and Brewing",
  "description": "Used most commonly for creating advanced brews that mundane Brewing Stands simply canâ€™t match. Certain other items can be boiled down and combined in the cauldron to create new ones. Cauldrons require magic energy and need a fire under them to work. At any point, Wood Ash can be thrown in to clear the cauldron. On top of this, a few food items can be made in a cauldron as well.",
